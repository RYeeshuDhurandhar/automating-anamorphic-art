# Automating Anamorphic Art
Anamorphic art refers to the art of arranging rigid objects in space to create 3D representations that appear differently when rendered from different angles.

We employ both Mesh and Signed Distance Function (SDFs) representations for creating anamorphic art. While the code for SDF-based representation is provided in this repository, the mesh-based representation code is not included due to privacy considerations.

The details of our methodology, approach, and results can be found in both the [report](https://github.com/RYeeshuDhurandhar/automating-anamorphic-art/blob/main/report.pdf) and [poster](https://github.com/RYeeshuDhurandhar/automating-anamorphic-art/blob/main/poster.pdf).
